Welcome to my blog!

Here I share stuff.
Said "stuff" being Linux/programming tutorials, some ideas and thoughts about the world too.
Maybe also some sort of so called "devlogs" of things I code.


As a little note, I write this blog in english but this is not my native speak.
Most of the time, it should still be a correct english, but... just so you know why I might write weird things.
