<h2 id="A%20brief%20timeline">A brief timeline</h2>

<p>Back in the days, I used to have a portative MP4 player.
It was simple, I could plug it to my computer, browse it&#39;s content and add new songs&#47;videos.</p>

<p>Then, I got an iPhone (4th gen, I think): to do the same thing, I had to use iTunes&#8230;</p>

<p>Then, I got my first Android phone (OnePlus X): I used to copy songs to an SD card which I then plugged into the phone.</p>

<p>For the past 2 years, I&#39;ve been using a Pixel 3.
Long story short: it&#39;s a nightmare.</p>

<ul>
<li>No jack output

<ul>
<li>I have to use a stupid USB-C to jack adapter or wireless headphones &#8212; no thanks for that last option.</li>
<li>I can&#39;t listen to music and charge the phone at the same time.</li>
<li>It&#39;s advertised as a way to make the phone thinner.
My OnePlus X is as thin if not thinner with the jack output and none of these problems.
Plus I don&#39;t care about how thick is my phone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>No SD card slot, which means I have to use the <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol">MTP</a>. It&#39;s <strong>full of bugs and almost never works</strong> (from my experience).</li>
<li>Recent Android version (9, I think). Makes me feel like I&#39;m being spied on in every way possible with all those Google things.</li>
<li>About one day of battery. I could do &#8212; and still can &#8212; at least 5 days with my OnePlus.</li>
<li>It&#39;s getting slower and slower&#8230; when it works&#8230;<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>We used to have simple things that worked.
Now we have complex pieces of bloatware selling themselves as &#8220;intelligent devices&#8221; but that won&#39;t allow you to do what you want with them.
It&#39;s sad.</p>

<p>On my OnePlus, I flashed <a href="https://lineageos.org">Lineage OS</a> with <a href="/blog/links.html#Android%20Apps">no Google apps</a>.
Even tho it&#39;s older and has poorer specs compared to the Pixel 3, it runs <strong>way better</strong>.</p>

<p>I come to the conclusion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People seem to thrive for technological &#8220;advancement&#8221;, but part of what they&#39;re doing is make things harder to use if not unusable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This applies to the real world too.
And sure, some might say &#8220;yeah we use MTP for security&#8221;, to which I&#39;d like to reply &#8220;not my problem if you plug your phone anywhere&#8221;.</p>

<h2 id="And%20a%20few%20more%20complaints%20about%20recent%20mobile%20phones">And a few more complaints about recent mobile phones</h2>

<ul>
<li>Not a tool anymore &#8212; a tool gets the work done, it does not try to seduce you</li>
<li>It gathers <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/doug.leith/apple_google.pdf">considerable amount of data</a> on your usage</li>
<li>No root access means you&#39;re not the owner of your phone, the manufacturer is</li>
<li>Inefficient, bloated code (AOSP &#8212; Android Open Source Project, is around 150GB of code&#8230; for a phone operating system)</li>
<li>It has sucked life out of majority of people: look at the zombie crowd holding their phones out there!</li>
<li>More to come&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="What%20to%20do?">What to do?</h2>

<p>I guess one could install an alternative operating system on their phone.
It would solve at least a few of the previously mentioned problems.
I&#39;m thinking about flashing my Pixel with <a href="https://calyxos.org/">Calyx OS</a> or <a href="https://grapheneos.org">Graphene OS</a>.</p>

<p>One could also take a first step into &#8220;better&#8221; phone usage by trying to switch away from all G-Apps (feaseable, I&#39;ve done it).</p>

<hr/>
<ol>

<li id="fn1">
<p>The reason for that seems to be a constant need of Internet for the phone to perform basic operations.
  I use <a href="https://netguard.me">NetGuard</a> to block some apps (such as Calculator, which definitely needs it&#8230;) from accessing Internet, and to use a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)">hosts file</a> which allows me to block certain domains.&#160;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
