<p class="date">20 Aug 2021</p>


<p>I have almost no reason to use Windows, but my laptop came with Windows 10 pre-installed on it.
I thought retreiving my Windows product key might still be useful in the future, so here are two ways you can do it.</p>

<h2 id="From%20Windows">From Windows</h2>

<p>Windows won&#39;t let you find your product key from the settings or from the control panel &#8212; well, at least I couldn&#39;t find it.
Fortunately, there is a command you can type in an administrator command prompt (cmd or Powershell, ran as administrator).</p>

<pre><code>wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey
</code></pre>

<h2 id="From%20Linux">From Linux</h2>

<p>You can get your Windows product key from a simple pseudo-file: <code>&#47;sys&#47;firmware&#47;acpi&#47;tables&#47;MSDM</code>.
Just use <code>more</code>, or <code>cat</code>, or whatever you want to read it&#39;s content.</p>

<pre><code>sudo cat &#47;sys&#47;firmware&#47;acpi&#47;tables&#47;MSDM
</code></pre>

<p>The file contains a bit more than the product key, but the product key is present.
It is formatted as such: <code>XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX</code>, at the end of the file.</p>
